// Define an object to create a Tree topology.

/* A Tree topology in this case is viewed as network of star topologies
 * A Tree has the following components:
 * 1 or more levels:
 * Level 0: has only 1 Node, the Root Node
 * The Nodes at the last level are considered Leaf Nodes
 * 
 * Each Node can have 1 or more branches.Each branch connects a Node to another 
 * Node at the next level
 *
 * Each Node (except the Root Node) therefore contains an Interface that points
 * towards the Root Node
 * Each Node (except the Leaf Nodes) contains an Interface that points towards
 * the leaf Node level

   * Assign Ipv4 addresses hierarchically

   * number of branches nodes/spokes nodes associated with a node
   * Each allocated subnet above is further divided into 2 subnets A and B
   * subnet A is used at the network between the hub and any spoke node
   * subnet B will be the new network which is used by the spoke nodes 
   * as part of recursion
   * For example:
   *
   * Stage 1:
   * 10.0.0.0/8 is allocated for the tree
   * The Root Node [R] has 4 point-to-point links to 4 spoke nodes
   * 10.0.0.0/8 is divided into 4 subnets
   * 10.0.0.0/10, 10.64.0.0/10, 10.128.0.0/10, 10.192.0.0/10
   * 
   * 10.0.0.0/10 is now allocated for the subnets towards N1 
   * N1 needs 4 subnets, 
   ** 1 for the link between N1 and X
   ** 1 for the link between N1 and Y
   ** 1 for the link between N1 and Z
   ** 1 for the link between N1 and the Root Node
   * Therefore 10.0.0.0/10 is divided to get 4 subnets by extending the
   * mask to /12.
